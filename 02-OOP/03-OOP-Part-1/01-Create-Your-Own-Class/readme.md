## Background & Objectives
- In OOP, we are trying to model data as real world objects.
- OOP = state + behaviour
- Create you first class object.
- `getter` and `setter` are two conventional methods that are used for `retrieving` and `updating` value of a variable.

## Specs
In this exercise, you are goning to implement several objects. Different object has different behaviors and states.

### `Product`
1. Create a `Product` class that accepts `name` and `price` as initial variables.
2. Implement `getter` and `setter` methods.

### `Circle`
1. Create a `Circle` class with default `radius=1.0` and `color=red`.
2. Implement `getter` and `setter` methods.
3. Implement `getCircumference` method to calucate circumference.

### `Rectangle`
1. Create a `Rectangle` class that accepts `length` and `width` as initial variables.
2. Implement `getter` and `setter` methods.
3. Implement `getArea` method to calucate area.
4. Implement `getPerimeter` method to calucate perimeter.

### `Employee`
1. Create a `Employee` class that takes `id`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `salary` and `salary` as initial variables.
2. Implement `getter` and `setter` methods.
3. Implement `getAnnualSalary` method to calucate annual salary.
4. Implement `raiseSalary` method that takes `percentage` as parameter to raise salary.

- Javascript was designed to be `prototype-based`.
- JavaScriptâ€™s support for OOP `is not at the same level` as other languages like Java.
- Javascript `does not support` encapsulation.
- We implemented our classes in `ES6` syntax.
