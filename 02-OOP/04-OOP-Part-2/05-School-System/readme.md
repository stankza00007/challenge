## Background & Objectives
Nathan wants to make a school system to manage his academy. He has `some basic requirements` for the new system:
1. As a `user`, I can `login` to the system.
1. As a `student`, I can `enroll` courses.
2. As a `student`, I can `browse` all available courses.
3. As a `student`, I can `see the details`of each individual course.
3. As a `student`, I can `see challenges` in a course.
4. As a `teacher`, I can `teach` courses.
4. As a `teacher`, I can `add teaching materials` to course.
4. As a `teacher`, I can `add challenges` to course.
5. As a `teacher`, I can `see how many students enrolled` my course.
6. As a `teacher`, I can `remove` `student` from my course.
7. As a `admin`, I can `create new course`.
8. As a `admin`, I can `assign teachers` to different courses.
9. As a `admin`, I can do what `student`, `teacher` and `user` can do.
10. As a `admin`, I can `create new user` and `assign role` to the user.

Nathan said he is open minded for any good suggestions, so feel free to add more functions to the system.

## Specs
In this exercise, you going to implement the whole system from scratch. Try to `design your own classes`, and implement the system based on the user requirements.

### Interactive Program
You should make an interface, so that a user can login to the system, and do what they are allowed to do.

For example:
```
Welcome to WA System!
Please login first!
Username: student1
Password: pwd

==============================
student1, Welcome back!
