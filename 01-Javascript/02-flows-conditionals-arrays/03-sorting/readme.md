## Specs

- Implement a `wagon_sort` method which takes one argument, an array of student names (`String`), and returns an array of those student names sorted alphabetically.
- The sorting method should be case insensitive, e.g. put `bob` before `Felix` (look at the [ASCII table](http://www.asciitable.com/))
- The method should keep the original spelling of the names.

## Key learning points

Get familiar with basic array operations. You should now know the syntax used to:

- create an array
- append a new element to the array
- access the nth element
- update an element
- delete a value at a given index
