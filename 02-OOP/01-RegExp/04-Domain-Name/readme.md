## Background & Objectives
We use IP address to receive and send data over the Internet, but we never use IP address to access a website, instead we use `Domain Name`. 

Domain name is a mapping id, which is mapped to a server IP address. Domain name gives every server a memorable and easy-to-spell address, such as `whiteboard.academy`. It hides the IP address that most users are not interested in seeing or using.

## Specs
- Write a function `get`, which takes domain name as parameter and return domain name.

### Interactive Program
- Once all your methods done, we want to use it in `lib/interface.js` which runs a command line tool. To launch this program, just run this in your terminal:

```bash
node lib/interface.js
```
- You will see:
```bash
Enter a Domain address: http://whiteboard.academy/

> Domain Name: whiteboard
```
