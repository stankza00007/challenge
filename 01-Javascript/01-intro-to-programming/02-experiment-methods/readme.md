## Background & Objectives
- Learn to look for the right method in the javascript docs
- Get familiar with using node to experiment with new methods.

* **Experiment the following lines** on node terminal:

```javascript
typeof "A string object"
typeof 19
"A string object".toUpperCase()
"A String Object".toLowerCase()
```

In javascript, everything (text, an integer, a floating number, an array...) is an object. We can call methods on these objects. 

## Specs

Find the right JavaScript methods of the [String class](https://devdocs.io/javascript-string/), the [Number class](https://devdocs.io/javascript-number/), and the [Array class](https://devdocs.io/javascript-array/) to plug in and make the tests pass.

Code is all about being smart and knowing how and where to look for the info you need! Often, the most difficult step is to ask google the right question. To find the methods you'll need for this challenge, use:

* Google and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* [The mozilla js documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) if you have a rough idea of the method you are looking for.

When you think you've found the method you're looking for, and you think you know how to use it, use IRB to test this method on something! Experimenting on node terminal is a crucial step for beginners.

## Key learning points

Are you able to answer the following questions? If not, you're not ready to move on!

- How many built-in JavaScript classes do you know? Which ones?
- What's the syntax to call a method on an object of these classes?
- What should be the immediate 1st step when you're looking to perform a standard operation (sorting an array, upcasing a word, etc.)?
- What's the second step, to make sure you really understand the method you found?
