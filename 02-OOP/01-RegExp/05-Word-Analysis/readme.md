## Background & Objectives
 "What do we say to death?, not today", Jimmy said. Jimmy is your friend, who is addicted to a book `Games of Thrones`. He loves the story so much. He is asking you to help him do some basic analysis of the book. He is curious about:
 - How many words in the book?
 - What is the top 5 most frequent words?

## Specs
- Write a function `readTextFile` that takes a file name as parameter and returns the content.
- Write a function `countWords` that return the `total number of words` of given string.
- Write a function `top5Words` that takes string as parameter and return the top 5 most frequent words.

### Interactive Program

```bash
node lib/interface.js
```
- You will see:
```bash
Enter file name: chapter1.txt
