## Background & Objectives

Learn the two ways to "loop" in JavaScript:

- With a `for` loop
- With a `forEach` loop
- With a `while` loop

## Specs

- Write a method in JavaScript that computes the sum of the integers between a min value and a max value (min and max included).
- If the min value is greater than the max value, it should return `-1`
- You should implement the two simple versions at least, using `for..end` and `while..end` structures.

## Further suggestions & resources

- [javascript loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)
- In Javascript, using an `forEach` iterator is considered more idiomatic than a `for` loop when you want to iterate through a collection. We will see that in the next days.

## Key learning points

- What's the difference between using a `while..end` and a `for..end` structure?
